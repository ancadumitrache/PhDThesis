abstract="In this paper we introduce the CrowdTruth open-source software framework for machine-human computation, that implements a novel approach to gathering human annotation data for a variety of media (e.g. text, image, video). The CrowdTruth approach embodied in the software captures human semantics through a pipeline of four processes: a) combining various machine processing of media in order to better understand the input content and optimize its suitability for micro-tasks, thus optimize the time and cost of the crowdsourcing process; b) providing reusable human-computing task templates to collect the maximum diversity in the human interpretation, thus collect richer human semantics; c) implementing 'disagreement metrics', i.e. CrowdTruth metrics, to support deep analysis of the quality and semantics of the crowdsourcing data; and d) providing an interface to support data and results visualization. Instead of the traditional inter-annotator agreement, we use their disagreement as a useful signal to evaluate the data quality, ambiguity and vagueness. We demonstrate the applicability and robustness of this approach to a variety of problems across multiple domains. Moreover, we show the advantages of using open standards and the extensibility of the framework with new data modalities and annotation tasks.",

In this paper we re-examine the Conference track of the OAEI, with a focus on the degree of agreement between the reference alignments within this track and the opinion of experts. We propose a new version of this benchmark that more closely corresponds to expert opinion and confidence on the matches. The performance of top alignment systems is compared on both versions of the benchmark. Additionally, a general method for crowdsourcing the development of more benchmarks of this type using Amazon's Mechanical Turk is introduced and shown to be scalable, cost-effective and to agree well with expert opinion.",

abstract="Over the last years, information extraction tools have gained a great popularity and brought significant performance improvement in extracting meaning from structured or unstructured data. For example, named entity recognition (NER) tools identify types such as people, organizations or places in text. However, despite their high F1 performance, NER tools are still prone to brittleness due to their highly specialized and constrained input and training data. Thus, each tool is able to extract only a subset of the named entities (NE) mentioned in a given text. In order to improve NE Coverage, we propose a hybrid approach, where we first aggregate the output of various NER tools and then validate and extend it through crowdsourcing. The results from our experiments show that this approach performs significantly better than the individual state-of-the-art tools (including existing tools that integrate individual outputs already). Furthermore, we show that the crowd is quite effective in (1) identifying mistakes, inconsistencies and ambiguities in currently used ground truth, as well as in (2) a promising approach to gather ground truth annotations for NER that capture a multitude of opinions.",

The demonstrator uses semantics from these enriched collections, their vocabularies and linked data vocabularies to establish connections between the collection media objects and the events, people, locations and concepts that are depicted or associated with those objects. The innovative interface combinesWeb technology and theory of interpretation to allow for browsing this network of data in an intuitive \"innite\" fashion.
